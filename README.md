# CMPG323---36309915---Project-5

This will be the final project for this module

I will be using PowerBI models & visualization to tell a story with the data in order for people to make informed business decisions based on the data available.

The PowerBI board is used to give you an overview of the data and help make decisions from there. 

Power BI can also be used to make dashboards in a sales environment, or do projections when using financial data. 

I have created a live connection to the online Sharepoint excel document, in other words my power BI report is automatically updated whenever the online doc changes.

1.
In order to access this report, you can view the online version in my app I created. The link is below: 
https://app.powerbi.com/Redirect?action=OpenApp&appId=2ed79be8-c327-4174-9a4e-cc1496e15a66&ctid=331c86e7-d032-436f-bc53-f2552d031012

If you would like to use and edit this report, you have to download Microsoft Power BI Desktop on your computer from the following link: 
https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/

- select the options for your PC specs

2.
You will then also have to clone the repo, and open up the pbix file in power BI desktop in order to edit the data/visualization or add more pages with visuals.

You can use the online app to view the report, and also filter on there

There is certain filters only on specific pages and then filters on all pages. 

You can use this report to make business decisions and get an precise high level overview of your data. 

I have created a calculated column called : Device_Overview & Device_Age_Days
